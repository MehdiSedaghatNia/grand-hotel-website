## Implementation process:

1. Initial implementation was done independently, without referencing the course material.



## Purpose
although the project was meant to be a flexbox pratice, I made it all by using combination of flexbox and grid layouts. additionally, I used modern CSS features for reausable code.
This project is a practice implementation for animation effects, vertical fixed sidebar, interacive navigation bar and flexible cards.  
The goal was to practice modern CSS techniques and build a fully responsive, professional-looking website while applying advanced styling and layout concepts.
